For the python packages to work, you need to create a virtual environment called 'venv'.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Then enter the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then you need to install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now, you can test the python scripts by running:

```bash
python [file].py
```

When you are finished, you can exit the python virtual environment using:

```bash
deactivate
```
